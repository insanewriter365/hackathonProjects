Some projects created in different hackathons

I have a knack for hackathons and love to make new things.
The thought of automating small things which trouble us sometimes made me to create some JS projects like Medi-mate, Unloading etc
Hackathons are the best way to put our ideas into action. 

I have participated in the following hackathons

1. GSB Hacks - An international women centric hackathon
2. Border Hacks'21 - An internation hackathon organised by Windsor Essex
3. Hack4Equality - An international hackathon orgnaised by Google's Women Techmakers, where I was one of the finalist among 24 students from Lesotho and India.
4. Uberposition - A hackathon for underrepresented genders and women, organised by Uber.
5. Nexus Design Trounce - A designathon organised by NIT Patna, India.
